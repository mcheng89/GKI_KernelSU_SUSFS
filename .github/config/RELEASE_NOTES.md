## [Kernel Flasher](https://github.com/fatalcoder524/KernelFlasher)

Recommended flashing utility

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Unlocked bootloader.
- Backup your current boot image.
- Have root access using Magisk / KernelSU / Apatch (Any forks).

### Via Kernel Flasher
Download the correct AnyKernel3 ZIP for your device.
If you previously used another root method, clean it up first:
a. Magisk: perform a complete uninstall after flashing the AnyKernel3 ZIP.
b. KSU LKM (boot/init_boot/vendor_boot‑patched): Flash back the stock boot/init_boot/vendor_boot depending on what you patched.
c. KSU GKI: if you are 100% sure you already flashed stock init_boot/boot/vendor_boot, no action is needed; otherwise, follow the same steps as KSU LKM.
d. APatch: remove /data/adb contents to avoid leftover root conflicts after flashing the AnyKernel3 ZIP.
Flash the ZIP to the active slot using Kernel Flasher.
Install the KernelSU‑Next Manager APK, same version as mentioned in the release notes.
Open the KernelSU‑Next app.
Reboot the device if you performed any cleanup in step 2
